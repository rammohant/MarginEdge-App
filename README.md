# SAFR Invoicing Camera Application 
### Awarded Second Place in 2020 RamHacks MarginEdge Challenge

## What it does
A mobile application created using Android Studio designed to provide a secure location to invoice sales data and any other relevant files into a centralized database from which MartinEdge can access and analyze all of their consumers' data. 

## How we built it
We built it using Java and Android Studio and used Google Cloud and FireBase for all authentication and database features. 

## Challenges we ran into
Given our lack of background on cloud technologies, there was a very steep learning curve in our use of cloud and FireBase technologies and all of the intricacies that went into creating a dynamic flow of information between our app and the Google Cloud server. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As mentioned in the challenges we faced, the lack of background in Google Cloud within our team made FireBase quite a weary task, however, we came out of RamHacks with a viable product that works and connects to a centralized database, which is not only an accomplishment but also a skill we can take to future projects and hackathons. 

## What's next for SAFR
Given more time, we hope to fix up the OpenCV and Vision API functionalities of our application, which would not only warn the user when the image was not taken properly but would also allow our app to use AI to read the contents of each image and upload them into the database for easy organization and access of invoices.
